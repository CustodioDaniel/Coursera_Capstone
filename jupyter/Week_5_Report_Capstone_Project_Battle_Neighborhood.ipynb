The data provider used was Foursquare API.\n### 1.3 The Location\nTo ilustrate this case, the cities of New York and Toronto were chosen."

Then, this dataframe was mined on retrieving data on amenities provided by Foursquare API.\nLimitations in the free license were taken into account when selecting the maximum number of results, 100, and the radius, 500 meters, of the search around the neighbourhood coordinates.\n### 3.6 Clustering Approach\nThe unsupervised machine-learning k-means clustering algorithm was used to group similar neighbourhoods with the goal of forming 5 clusters.\nThis approach was used due to its speed and guaranteed convergence.\n### 3.7 Main Libraries Used\n- Pandas\n- Folium\n- Scikit Learn\n- JSON\n- Geocoder\n- Requests\n- Matplotlib"
